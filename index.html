            <h2>Dear Bunny,</h2>
            <p>I adore you more than u could ever know. Honestly, after everything we have been through recently.. I was scared .. scared of losing the single most important thing in my life. I know I havent been the best bf to you of late even though u tell me otherwise, but i promise u baby, i am committed to us and i will do anything and everything it takes to be with you forever because theres nothing in this planet more important to me than you are. No distance or any obstacle can stop us being together. I love everything about you, ur perfect attirbutes and ur imperfections make u who u are and i just am blessed to know u, let alone call u mine. I never take u for granted ever cuz i know just how lucky i am that u chose me. Even though ur slightly annoying lol, i would rather be in a lon distance with you than in a relationship with any other girl in this world. I hope you know just how much i love u. If u dont and its because of how i have been treating you, i promise i will do everything to show u everyday just how happy u  make me. From the first day I saw u all those years ago I knew u were always meant for me and from hugging that pole I now get to hug the love of my life and I feel loved and safe in ur arms.. it’s the best feeling … thank u for everything u do for me every little bit u do for me warms my heart and it just makes me happy and I want that feeling forever. thank u for tolerating all my rubbish ,my drama my rudeness but I just want u to know ur baby boy always will be by u and will never ever let u down ❤️❤️</p>
            <p>sooooo.... I just have one thing i wanna ask you.👀👀👀</p>
